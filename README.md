## Technical Setup and Usage

### As a user

You can test our visualization in your browser using the following link: [https://com-480-data-visualization.github.io/com-480-project-big-yoshi-club/](https://com-480-data-visualization.github.io/com-480-project-big-yoshi-club/)

### As a developer

If you want to develop on this project, you will need to run a node.js server to serve local files to your browser, as browsers usually block loading large CSV files in any other way than through HTTP requests. All files are stored in the `website/` directory, other top-level directories hold data for the README, milestones, and data analysis. Assuming you have `npm` installed, to test your version run:

```
$ cd website/
$ npm install && npm start
```

Then open in your browser the address node.js prints in the terminal. As this project is delivered, it should be `localhost:3000`.
