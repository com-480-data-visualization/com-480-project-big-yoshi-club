# Dataset Ideas

- [Exoplanet Hunting in Deep Space](https://www.kaggle.com/keplersmachines/kepler-labelled-time-series-data)
  - Description:
    - Lots of stuff
    - ~5.6k data points
  - Could plot #exo-stars vs their class
  - Could plot exo-stars/#exo-planets vs discovery method
  - Could plot #exo-planets vs orbital period
  - Could plot #exo-planets vs theoretical habitable zone
  - Could plot #exo-planets vs temperature
- [Meteorite Landings](https://www.kaggle.com/nasa/meteorite-landings)
  - Description:
    - Meteorite Landings across the world from NASA
    - Year, lat-lon, class, mass, whether the fall was observed or not and composition of meteorite
    - ~45k data points (lines)
  - Could display an earth map representation of impacts
  - Could compare the geo distribution of observed falls vs found meteorites
  - Could plot class/mass vs geographical location or time
- [Lightning Strikes on Earth](https://www.kaggle.com/noaa/noaa-severe-weather-data-inventory)
  - Description:
    - Lightning Strikes from Vaisala NLDN 1986 - 2019
    - Date (YYYY-MM-DD), lat-lon (within 0.1 deg), count(?) of each strike
    - ~93M data points (lines)
    - Seems to be limited to the US :(
  - Could display an earth map representation of strikes
    - => See geographical changes
  - Plot dynamic representation of strikes against time of the year
    - => See seasonal changes
  - Combine Seasonal plot with Geographical Plot to see which regions of the world are struck when
  - Plot Strike Frequency against Latitude
- [Worldwide Significant Earthquakes](https://www.kaggle.com/usgs/earthquake-database)
  - Description:
    - Significant earthquakes worldwide 1965 - 2016
    - ~23k datapoints
    - Date (MM-DD-YYYY), time, lat-lon, (earthquake/nuclear explosion), depth, magnitude, etc.
  - Could plot earthquakes lat-lon on map to show seismologically active regions
  - Could plot nuclear earthquakes
